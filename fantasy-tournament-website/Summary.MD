## 💰 Wallet System Business Logic

### Deposit System
1. **User Deposits Money** → **Wallet Balance**
2. **Wallet Balance** → **Used for Tournament Entry Fees**
3. **Entry Fees** → **Deducted from Wallet Balance**

### Withdrawal System
1. **Admin Awards Prize** → **Winnings Balance**
2. **Winnings Balance** → **Available for Withdrawal**
3. **Users Cannot Withdraw** → **Original Deposits (Wallet Balance)**

### Transaction Flow
```
Deposit → Wallet Balance → Tournament Entry → Prize Award → Winnings Balance → Withdrawal
```

This system ensures users can only withdraw money they've won, not their original deposits, providing platform revenue through entry fees while maintaining fair prize distribution.
